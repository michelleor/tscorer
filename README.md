This is a small project to build a web application for keeping score in a Real Tennis match.

The project is mostly as a personal learning excercise, building and deploying the application using Yeoman for the workflow (to learn Grunt, Jasmine etc).  The application will be built with Angularjs

The UI will be designed to work on mobile devices using Bootstrap.
